 treehouse project #5
Build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup. Use the Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random 'employees', and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employmee directory. Request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information.
